# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous middleware can lead to server crashes or unexpected 500 errors without sending a proper response to the client.

## The Problem

When using promises within Express.js middleware, it's crucial to handle potential errors using `.catch()` to prevent unhandled promise rejections. If an error occurs in an asynchronous operation and isn't handled, Express.js won't automatically send a meaningful response, possibly resulting in a cryptic 500 Internal Server Error.  This can make debugging difficult.

## The Solution

The solution involves properly handling potential errors within the `.catch()` block of your promise chain.  The error should be logged for debugging purposes and a proper HTTP response should be sent to the client indicating the error (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error with a descriptive error message).
